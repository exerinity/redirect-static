# Redirect
This is a simple page for redirecting a domain. It is designed for [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.dev), static, client side scripting.

# How it works
## index.html
Simple <meta> refresh tag

## Other pages
Will send a 404. That 404 will check the path name, and send you to another website WITH that path name

Pretty simple!

Feel free to use however you like


# Other hosts
## Neocities
Rename "404.html" to "not_found.html"

*I have only used Neocities and CF Pages so far; so I don't know how to use it. I would say just set `404.html` as the 404 error page*
