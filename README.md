# Redirect
This is a simple page for redirecting a domain. It is designed for [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.dev), or anything that offers static page hosting.

# How to use
Simply copy both `index.html` and `404.html` to your server.

This was designed for use with Cloudflare Pages (workers). You may need to adjust it:

## [Neocities](https://neocities.org)
- Rename `404.html` to `not_found.html`

## Other servers/hosts
I have not tested this with anything other than CF Pages and Neocities.

Please check the documentation
